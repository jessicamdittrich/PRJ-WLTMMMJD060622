# WhatTheFridge.
A Collaboration By: William Liao & Taylor Moss & Mubashera Mashraka & Jessica Dittrich

## Objective 
WhatTheFridge was developed to combat food waste and maximize the value of exisiting food (ingridients and condiments) in the home. In this effort, the user would provide the names and titles of the ingredients that they have in their possession. The website, in return, provides a list of possible recipies and allows the user to save and/or add the recipies they have chosen to work with. Additionally, a quotation section on the user interface encourages the user to persevere and contribute to the minimization of food waste and develop a healty habit of curating one's own food. 

## Approach
User Interface: In order to create a distraction free and efficiently accessible website, a minimalistic and clean cut user interface was curated, allowing all the attention to be on the ingredients and recipies discovered. However, to combat apathy, a fun quote related to food is posted to make the application fun. 

External Sources 
   A total of two APIs are used in this project: 
      - The first API,' Yummly' (https://rapidapi.com/apidojo/api/yummly2/) is used to discover recipies in accordance to the ingredients posted by the user, to create a collection of possible dishes 
      - The second API, 'Famous Quotes' (https://rapidapi.com/saicoder/api/famous-quotes4/) is used to generate a new quote every few seconds to add an element of fun 

Collaboration: For the purpose of producing this project, team members (i.e., William Liao, Taylor Moss, Mubashera Mashraka & Jessica Dittrich) divided up the work into certain duties and thus were assigned tasks.
