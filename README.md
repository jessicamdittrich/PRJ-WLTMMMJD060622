# WhatTheFridge.
A Collaboration By: William Liao & Taylor Moss & Mubashera Mashraka & Jessica Dittrich

## Objective 
WhatTheFridge was developed to combat food waste and maximize the value of exisiting food (ingridients and condiments) in the home. In this effort, the user would provide the names and titles of the ingredients that they have in their possession. The website, in return, provides a list of possible recipies and allows the user to save and/or add the recipies they have chosen to work with. 

In order to encourage the user to push past the usual cooking frustration(s), the website also provides quote to motivate the user to persevere.
