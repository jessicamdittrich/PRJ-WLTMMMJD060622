# WhatTheFridge.
A collaboration by: Jessica Dittrich & William Liao & Mubashera Mashraka & Taylor Moss

## Objective 
WhatTheFridge. was developed to combat food waste and maximize the value of exisiting food in the home. In this effort, the user would provide the names of ingredients that they have in their possession. The website, in return, provides a list of possible recipies and allows the user to save and/or add the recipies they have chosen to utilize. Additionally, a quotation section on the user interface encourages the user to persevere and contribute to the minimization of food waste and develop a healty habit of curating one's own food. 

## Approach
In order to create a distraction free and efficiently accessible website, a minimalistic and clean cut user interface was curated, allowing all the attention to be on the ingredients and recipies discovered. However, to combat apathy, a fun quote related to food is posted to make the application fun.

## Reflection
Following completion of the project and intensive testing, we were all happy with the outcome aside from one thing. It was noticed that the API Yummly advertised that recipes were pulled based on ingredients but it was determined that was not the case. Repipes are pulled from title name which was not our intention with the project. Pulling ingredients seems to be a locked and paid feature. After finishing the project and creating everything surrounding this API, it was decided that we would not switch and proceed with this as it does still reach our target audience.
